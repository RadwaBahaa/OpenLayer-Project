# OpenLayers Map Visualization with ReactJS

This project leverages the power of React.js and OpenLayers to create an interactive map visualization application. The primary focus of this application is to provide a user-friendly map interface with support for both dark and light modes, integrated geocoding for location search, and weather data display within popups.

## Features

- **Map Visualization**: Display an interactive map using OpenLayers, allowing users to pan, zoom, and interact with geographic data.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes for map visualization based on user preferences.
- **Geocoding and Search**: Implement geocoding functionality to search for locations on the map using text input.
- **Popup Display**: Show popups with weather data when clicking on searched locations or clustered features on the map.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **OpenLayers**: JavaScript library for displaying map data in web browsers.
- **Context API**: React's Context API is used for managing global state, enabling theme switching and data sharing.
- **useState Hook**: Utilized to manage component-level state for controlling map themes and search results.
- **useRef Hook**: Used to access and manipulate DOM elements, such as the map container.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a visually appealing and interactive map application that provides users with the following functionalities:

- Visualize map data with support for dark and light themes to suit different preferences.
- Enable users to search for specific locations using geocoding services, displaying markers and popups on the map.
- Display weather information within popups when clicking on searched locations or cluster features on the map, enhancing the user experience with additional contextual data.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized following React best practices, with components responsible for different aspects of the application:

- **Map Component**: Contains the OpenLayers map instance and handles map interactions.
- **Search Component**: Manages location search using geocoding services and displays results on the map.
- **Popup Component**: Renders popups with weather data when triggered by user interactions.

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements for this project could include:

- Implementing additional map layers (e.g., satellite imagery, terrain data).
- Enhancing search capabilities with autocomplete suggestions.
- Optimizing performance, especially for large datasets and clustered features.
